- [2025-05-23] Footer components should be modular with clear data organization for navigation links and social media to ensure maintainability and scalability
- [2025-05-23] Fixed hydration mismatch in ThemeProvider by adding mounted state to prevent SSR/client render differences - always use mounted checks for client-side-only state like localStorage or system preferences
- [2025-05-23] Fixed circular CSS references in typography utilities by replacing self-referencing classes (text-display, text-h1, etc.) with actual Tailwind size classes (text-6xl, text-5xl, etc.)
- [2025-05-23] Resolved all CSS compilation issues by replacing CSS custom properties (text-muted-foreground, bg-card, etc.) with standard Tailwind color classes (text-gray-500, bg-white, etc.)
- [2025-05-23] Successfully flattened project structure by moving all files from web/ directory to root level for cleaner organization
- [2025-05-23] Fixed Tailwind CSS configuration by downgrading from v4 (experimental) to v3 (stable) and adding proper PostCSS configuration
- [2025-05-23] Dark mode implementation requires 'darkMode: "class"' in tailwind.config.js and comprehensive dark: variants throughout components for proper theme switching
- [2025-05-23] Header layout improvements: increased height from h-16 to h-20, larger logo (28px), better spacing (gap-4), and proper dark mode styling prevents cut-off appearance
- [2025-05-23] Color hierarchy improvements: replaced excessive white backgrounds with gradient backgrounds, colored sections, and proper light/dark mode variants to create visual interest and reduce monotony
- [2025-05-23] Loading states and micro-animations implementation: created comprehensive loading component library with sophisticated animations - intersection observer API is essential for performant scroll-triggered animations, and staggered animation timing creates professional sequential effects that guide user attention naturally
- [2025-05-23] GitHub push failed due to a >100MB file in node_modules accidentally committed. Used git-filter-repo with --force to remove node_modules/@next/swc-darwin-arm64/next-swc.darwin-arm64.node from history, then force-pushed. All collaborators must re-clone the repository. .gitignore now properly excludes node_modules. Repository is now compliant with GitHub's file size limits.
- [2025-05-23] Homepage hero SVG illustration created and integrated as a React component. Illustration is responsive, accessible, and visually matches the premium Cheflyte design system. HeroSection now supports an illustration prop. Subtask complete and ready for user review.
- [2025-05-23] Custom World-Class Professional Chefs SVG illustration created and integrated into the FeatureShowcase section. Icon is responsive, accessible, and visually matches the Cheflyte design system. Subtask complete and ready for user review.
- [2025-05-23] Modern, unified hero illustration redesign completed inspired by Vouch website: replaced scattered floating elements with cohesive network diagram showing AI chef matching process (Chef â†’ AI Brain â†’ Processing â†’ Customer â†’ Match Result). Added connected animated lines, professional white container with subtle borders, meaningful storytelling, and clear descriptive text. Illustration now feels integrated and modern rather than disjointed. Vertical slice complete and ready for user review.
- [2025-05-23] Animation loading issue fixed: improved LottieAnimation component with comprehensive error handling, loading states with animated fallback icons, and proper Lottie JSON format. Created better chef-cooking.json animation file with complete Lottie specification. Component now gracefully falls back to ChefHat icon if animation fails to load. Animation vertical slice complete and ready for user review.
- [2025-05-23] Large, prominent hero illustration completed inspired by Vouch website design: created 120px chef hat with floating animated elements (sparkles, stars, utensils), gradient container with backdrop blur, staggered animations, and increased hero height to 400px. Illustration now has significant visual impact similar to modern SaaS landing pages. Vertical slice complete and ready for user review.
- [2025-05-23] Next-generation hero section completed without illustration: removed illustration and created engaging, modern hero with dramatically larger typography (up to 9xl), animated gradient orbs, subtle grid pattern overlay, enhanced CTAs with better sizing (xl buttons with custom padding), improved spacing (py-24 lg:py-40), responsive design that scales based on illustration presence. Hero now feels premium and next-gen with clean, simple, engaging design. Vertical slice complete and ready for user review.
- [2025-05-23] Hero typography fixed to be simple yet appealing like Vouch website: reduced overly large text sizes from up to 9xl down to balanced 4xl-6xl for titles, descriptions from 4xl down to lg-2xl, normalized button sizing from xl to lg, improved line-height from 0.9 to 1.1 for readability, reduced gaps and spacing for cleaner proportions. Updated style guide examples with cleaner, more engaging copy. Hero now feels balanced and professional rather than overwhelming. Vertical slice complete and ready for user review.
- [2025-05-23] Button icon alignment: Always use leftIcon and rightIcon props instead of placing SVG icons directly in button children with manual mr-2/ml-2 spacing - this ensures proper alignment and consistent spacing across all button variants and sizes
- [2025-05-23] Button variant contrast: Ghost button variant needed darker text color (text-secondary instead of text-muted) for proper visibility in light mode, especially for signin buttons in navigation
- [2025-05-23] Arrow icon placement: Arrows in buttons should always use rightIcon prop to be positioned on the right side, aligned with text, indicating forward action - avoid manual ml-2 spacing within button children
- [2025-05-23] CallToAction text contrast: Gradient variant CallToAction component needed white text instead of black text for proper visibility on dark gradient backgrounds - fixed textStyles.gradient to 'text-white'
- [2025-05-23] Section visual separation: Added background colors and negative margins to create clear visual breaks between different page sections - features section now has bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900/50 with full-width background using -mx and corresponding px padding
- [2025-05-23] Button text contrast: Light mode signin button text needed much darker color for visibility - changed --color-text-secondary from gray-500 (#6b7280) to gray-800 (#1f2937) for proper contrast in light mode ghost buttons
- [2025-05-23] Visual section separation: Use contrasting background colors (bg-gray-100 vs bg-gray-50), border-y borders, and increased padding (py-20) to create prominent visual breaks between page sections - features and testimonials sections now have clear visual distinction from hero and stats sections
- [2025-05-23] Vouch-style end-to-end sections: Implement full-width sections by removing constrained containers and applying section-level backgrounds with constrained content containers inside - hero (gradient blue/purple), features (gray), testimonials (white), stats (gradient primary/accent), CTA (gray) creates clear visual hierarchy like Vouch website with proper edge-to-edge visual separation
- [2025-05-23] Nested sections issue: Marketing components already include their own section wrappers with built-in spacing and layout - wrapping them in additional sections creates nested semantic issues and conflicting styles. Use className prop to override component backgrounds instead of wrapping in sections for clean, consistent layout

## Lessons Learned
- [2025-05-22] Design system must evolve to match user expectations for premium AI platforms
- [2025-05-22] Apple.com demonstrates how extreme minimalism can convey sophistication and trust
- [2025-05-22] Modern web design requires sophisticated color systems, not just primary brand colors
- [2025-05-22] Authentication testing revealed need for more premium, modern aesthetic before continuing development

- [2025-01-26] Style guide implementation: Comprehensive documentation with interactive examples creates developer confidence and ensures design system adoption - live demos are essential for understanding component capabilities and proper usage patterns
- [2025-01-26] Theme system refactoring: Using semantic CSS variables (--color-bg-primary) instead of direct Tailwind classes enables robust theming systems and ensures consistent design token usage across light/dark modes
- [2025-01-26] Client component configuration: For interactive homepage components, use 'use client' directive at the top of the page to enable onClick handlers and interactive functionality - server components cannot pass event handlers to client components
- [2025-01-26] Marketing page flow: Optimal conversion flow follows AIDA framework (Attention â†’ Interest â†’ Desire â†’ Action) with strategic placement of hero, features, social proof, statistics, and call-to-action sections
- [2025-05-23] Button icon alignment: Always use leftIcon and rightIcon props instead of placing SVG icons directly in button children with manual mr-2/ml-2 spacing - this ensures proper alignment and consistent spacing across all button variants and sizes
- [2025-05-23] Button variant contrast: Ghost button variant needed darker text color (text-secondary instead of text-muted) for proper visibility in light mode, especially for signin buttons in navigation
- [2025-05-23] Arrow icon placement: Arrows in buttons should always use rightIcon prop to be positioned on the right side, aligned with text, indicating forward action - avoid manual ml-2 spacing within button children
- [2025-05-23] CallToAction text contrast: Gradient variant CallToAction component needed white text instead of black text for proper visibility on dark gradient backgrounds - fixed textStyles.gradient to 'text-white'
- [2025-05-23] Section visual separation: Added background colors and negative margins to create clear visual breaks between different page sections - features section now has bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900/50 with full-width background using -mx and corresponding px padding
- [2025-05-23] Button text contrast: Light mode signin button text needed much darker color for visibility - changed --color-text-secondary from gray-500 (#6b7280) to gray-800 (#1f2937) for proper contrast in light mode ghost buttons
- [2025-05-23] Visual section separation: Use contrasting background colors (bg-gray-100 vs bg-gray-50), border-y borders, and increased padding (py-20) to create prominent visual breaks between page sections - features and testimonials sections now have clear visual distinction from hero and stats sections
- [2025-05-23] Vouch-style end-to-end sections: Implement full-width sections by removing constrained containers and applying section-level backgrounds with constrained content containers inside - hero (gradient blue/purple), features (gray), testimonials (white), stats (gradient primary/accent), CTA (gray) creates clear visual hierarchy like Vouch website with proper edge-to-edge visual separation
- [2025-05-23] Nested sections issue: Marketing components already include their own section wrappers with built-in spacing and layout - wrapping them in additional sections creates nested semantic issues and conflicting styles. Use className prop to override component backgrounds instead of wrapping in sections for clean, consistent layout

## Current Task

- Task 17: Custom Illustrations & Iconography

## Notes
- Refactoring all color usage in UI components to use semantic CSS variables (e.g., var(--color-bg-primary), var(--color-text-primary), etc.) instead of direct Tailwind color classes.
- Initial mapping: Tailwind color classes (bg-primary-600, text-gray-900, etc.) will be replaced with semantic CSS variable-based classes or inline styles.
- First vertical slice: Refactor Button component to use semantic variables for all color/background/border usages.
