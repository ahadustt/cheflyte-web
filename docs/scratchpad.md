### Production Platform (PAUSED AT TASK 4)
- Tasks 1-3 completed: Infrastructure, Firebase Auth, and authentication system
- Authentication testing completed successfully with modern UI
- Task 4 (Protected Route System) ready to proceed when redesign is complete

### Modern Design System Redesign (NEW - PRIORITY)
- **Analysis Complete**: Current design system identified as outdated and not premium-feeling
- **Research Complete**: 2025 web design trends analyzed, Apple.com design principles studied
- **Vision Established**: Transform Cheflyte into sophisticated, next-gen AI platform aesthetic
- **Comprehensive Plan Created**: 18 tasks across 6 phases from color system to performance optimization
- **Inspiration Sources**: Apple.com minimalism, Linear gradients, Figma component design, modern SaaS aesthetics

**Key Redesign Elements:**
- Complete color system overhaul (moving from earthy to sophisticated tech palette)
- Typography hierarchy with expressive, bold fonts
- Modern logo and brand mark redesign
- Sophisticated component system with micro-animations
- Dark mode design that feels intentional
- Apple-inspired minimalism with purposeful white space

**Proposed Approach:**
- Phase 1: Brand Foundation (colors, typography, logo)
- Phase 2: Component System Modernization (buttons, forms, cards)
- Phase 3: Advanced UI Patterns (animations, dashboards)
- Phase 4: Dark Mode & Theming
- Phase 5: Brand Applications (style guide, homepage, dashboards)
- Phase 6: Advanced Features & Polish
