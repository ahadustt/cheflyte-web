# Modern Cheflyte Design System Redesign

**Task Name Slug:** modern-cheflyte-redesign  
**Created:** 2025-05-22  
**Branch Name:** feat/modern-design-system

---

## Background and Motivation

The current Cheflyte design system, while functional, lacks the modern, next-generation appeal that today's users expect from premium AI-powered platforms. Drawing inspiration from Apple.com's sophisticated minimalism and 2025 web design trends, we need to reimagine Cheflyte as a cutting-edge, premium brand that feels both innovative and approachable.

**Current Issues Identified:**
- Color palette feels dated and overly earthy (sage greens, mustard yellows)
- Typography lacks hierarchy and modern expressiveness
- Logo appears simplistic and not memorable
- Overall aesthetic doesn't convey the AI-powered, premium nature of the platform
- UI components feel generic rather than brand-distinctive

**Vision for Modern Cheflyte:**
- Sleek, premium aesthetic that rivals Apple, Figma, and Linear
- Sophisticated color system with depth and nuance
- Bold, expressive typography that commands attention
- Memorable brand identity that reflects AI innovation
- Micro-interactions and animations that delight users
- Accessibility-first approach with beautiful contrast

**New Features to be Added:**
- Add a modern, premium footer to improve navigation, trust, and brand completeness, inspired by leading SaaS platforms ([Vouchport example](https://staging.vouchport.com/)).
