## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- User has confirmed all dashboard components look correct in both light and dark mode. Task 13: Theme System Implementation is now complete.
- Reminder: Add any missing semantic tokens (e.g., --color-info, --color-info-bg, --color-accent, --color-accent-bg, --color-warning, --color-warning-bg, --color-success-bg) to globals.css as a follow-up for full theme support.
